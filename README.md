# Delayed Buffer To Log


This is RTXI model plugin.
The purpose of this model is to have the ability to log history data from channel by trigger.
For example: we want to record 1 millisecond of Volt activity before spike and 2 milliseconds after. when we identify the spike we trigger the model to start record the activity, the recorder data is the delayed data.
